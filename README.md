Project 2 for DWA-15: Password Generator

Note: The first day of working on this, I got wrapped up in working on the code and completely forgot about version control, so most of the major edits had already happened before the first commit. (Earlier commits, had they existed, would not have had "dictionary.php"--I used a short, hard-coded array of words to begin with while working out the logic in "password_logic" and then started looking into strategies for scraping dictionary sites.)
